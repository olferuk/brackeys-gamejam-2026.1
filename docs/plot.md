# MEND — Story Draft

## Setting

**England. 1879.**

A private sanatorium in the countryside. A former manor house, converted into a treatment facility for "consumptives" — tuberculosis patients.

Long corridors. High ceilings. Paintings on the walls — left behind by the previous owners. No one took them down. No one cared to.

## Protagonist

A child. Boy? Girl? It doesn't matter. Their face is never shown. Only hands — thin, pale — and occasionally a reflection in dark windows. Blurred.

They've been placed in a separate room in the east wing. Away from the others. *"So as not to disturb."*

They're forbidden from leaving. But at night, the door is somehow unlocked.

## Core Loop

### Day

The room. A bed. A window, boarded up against drafts. Sounds through the wall — muffled voices of staff, footsteps, clinking dishes. Sometimes — coughing from distant rooms.

The player does nothing. Just watches. Listens. Waits for night.

### Night

The child rises. Takes a candle (or is it already burning?). Steps into the corridor.

The sanatorium at night is different. Shadows stretch longer. Corridors seem endless. The paintings on the walls... are they watching?

Approaches a painting. Touches it. Falls through.

### Inside the Painting

A world made of brushstrokes. Not quite real. A puzzle/mini-game — 30-40 seconds.

Upon completion — scissors appear. Children's scissors, with blunt tips. Where from? It doesn't matter.

Cuts out a fragment of the canvas. Carefully. Slowly.

The world of the painting behind them — crumbles. Paint cracks, peels away, revealing emptiness.

### Return

The corridor. The painting on the wall — ruined. A hole in the canvas.

The child returns to their room. Lies down.

Where the fragment went — not shown.

## Days Between Nights

Voices (gibberish, but understandable by tone):

*"...another one of the paintings..."*

*"...edges are clean, as if cut with scissors..."*

*"...one of the patients? they can barely walk..."*

*"...maybe the staff is stealing to sell?..."*

*"...the child from the east wing? they haven't gotten up in a week..."*

With each cycle — the voices grow more anxious. The sanatorium buzzes with rumors. Someone is ruining the paintings. No one is caught.

---

## Progression

**The child's room changes.**

At first — empty. Bed, nightstand, window.

With each passing night:
- Candles burn dimmer
- The blanket seems heavier
- The window fogs up, despite the heating

And under the bed...

The player accidentally (or intentionally?) looks beneath:

**A collage.**

Fragments of paintings. Glued together with something. Wax? Clumsy, but careful. A forest from one painting. Sky from another. A piece of someone's face. A sea they've never seen.

It's not a puzzle. Not a goal. It unlocks nothing.

It simply — exists.

---

## Finale

**The last night.**

The corridor. One painting remains — large, in the main hall. The darkest one. What's on it — impossible to tell.

The child walks toward it. Slower than usual. The candle in their hand trembles.

They touch it.

**Inside:**

Emptiness. Not a world — just... nothing. Darkness stretching in all directions.

No puzzle. No objective.

Only — in the distance — something glows. You can walk toward it. For a long time.

Whether they reach it or not — the player decides. Or doesn't. Maybe it's not a choice.

**Morning.**

The room in the east wing.

The bed is neatly made. Empty.

The staff found the collage. It lies on the nightstand. Who placed it there — unknown.

A nurse looks at it for a long time. Doesn't understand what it is. Why.

Does she throw it away? Keep it?

The camera doesn't show.

**Black screen.**

## Post-Credits (Optional)

A static shot:

The same sanatorium corridor. Daytime. Sunlight through dusty windows.

On the wall — where the ruined painting once hung — now hangs the collage.

In a cheap frame.

Who hung it — unknown.

---

## Tone

Quiet. Slow. No jumpscares. No answers.

The child saved no one. Changed nothing. They simply — existed. Did something only they understood.

And left.

## Themes

- **Mend** — the act of repairing, but also the futility of it
- The collage repairs nothing; it's creation for creation's sake
- Terminal illness as isolation
- Art as escape, but also as destruction (each painting is ruined)
- The living don't notice; the dying see differently

## Key Design Principles

- No names. No faces. No backstory dumps.
- Nothing happens *because* of the child. The mystery is never solved.
- The collage is purely decorative — no gameplay benefit
- Player expectations are subverted: progress makes things worse, not better
- Gibberish voices keep the player at a distance — they're an outsider, like the child
