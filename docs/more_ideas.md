# More Mini-Game Ideas

Additional concepts for painting-based mini-games. Victorian era, simple mechanics, creepy undertones.

## Based on Painting Genres

### Still Life Paintings

**1. Rotting Fruit**
- A bowl of fruit. Click to "preserve" pieces before they rot.
- Each click freezes a fruit, but others decay faster.
- Impossible to save them all. Watch the still life die.
- *Creepy: The last fruit has a face.*

**2. Vanitas / Skull Arrangement**
- Arrange objects around a skull: candle, book, flower, hourglass.
- Each placement triggers a symbolic sound (bell toll, page turn, petal fall).
- When complete, the skull's eyes ignite.
- *Simple drag-and-drop.*

**3. Candles Going Out**
- Multiple candles, wind blowing through.
- Shield them with cursor. If all go out — fail.
- But keeping them lit reveals something in the shadows you didn't want to see.
- *Cursor as wind-blocker.*

---

### Portrait Paintings

**4. Reconstruct the Face**
- Scrambled portrait tiles (3x3 or 4x4 sliding puzzle).
- Solve to reveal the face.
- *Creepy: The solved face is wrong. Features in wrong places. Or it's YOUR reflection.*

**5. Age the Portrait**
- Portrait starts young. Click to age it (Dorian Gray reverse).
- Stop at the "correct" age.
- If you go too far — skeleton.
- *Timing/judgment game.*

**6. The Blinking Portrait**
- Portrait stares at you. Click when it blinks.
- It rarely blinks. Miss it, wait again.
- Each blink is shorter. Anxiety builder.
- *Reaction time + patience.*

**7. Make Them Smile**
- Drag mouth corners to form a smile.
- The face resists. Keeps going neutral or frowning.
- Eventually you force a smile. It's deeply unsettling.
- *Drag mechanic with resistance.*

---

### Landscape Paintings

**8. Fog Navigation**
- Landscape covered in fog. Reveal by moving cursor.
- Find the path through. But fog returns behind you.
- Something follows in the fog.
- *Reveal + memory.*

**9. Sunset Timer**
- Sun is setting. Reach the house before dark.
- Move with WASD or clicks. Simple pathing.
- If sun sets — you're not alone in the dark.
- *Natural timer (no UI numbers).*

**10. Counting Crows**
- Crows in a dead tree. They fly randomly.
- Count how many there are. Input number.
- Wrong = they notice you.
- *Attention + counting.*

**11. Stone Balancing**
- Stack stones by a river (click timing).
- Each stone is harder to balance.
- Tower falls = start over. 
- Meditative until you realize the reflections in the water are wrong.
- *Timing stacking game.*

---

### Religious / Mythological Paintings

**12. Light the Altar Candles**
- Candles in specific order (remember the sequence).
- Wrong order = all extinguish.
- Complete sequence = something appears at the altar.
- *Memory sequence.*

**13. Prayer Beads**
- Click beads in rhythm with a chant (gibberish latin).
- Miss the rhythm = start over.
- Complete = silence. Absolute. Wrong kind of peace.
- *Rhythm game.*

**14. Angel or Demon**
- Two figures, obscured. Shine light to reveal.
- Limited light (resource). Choose who to illuminate.
- Both are wrong. Neither is safe.
- *Resource management + choice.*

**15. Ascension Timing**
- Figure rising to heaven. Click at peak to release.
- Too early = falls. Too late = consumed by light.
- What is salvation here?
- *Single timing click.*

---

### Maritime / Ship Paintings

**16. Navigate by Stars**
- Night sea. Stars above. 
- Rotate the ship to match a constellation.
- Wrong direction = the sea gets angry.
- *Rotation matching.*

**17. Signal the Shore**
- Lighthouse in distance. Flash your lantern to match its pattern.
- Match = rescue? Or lure something closer.
- *Pattern matching.*

**18. Keep the Ship Level**
- Waves rock the ship. Balance with left/right.
- If balanced too long, you see what's under the water.
- *Balance mini-game.*

**19. Count the Drowned**
- Faces in the waves. Count them.
- They appear and disappear.
- The number is always wrong. There's always one more.
- *Counting / attention.*

---

### Hunting / Animal Paintings

**20. Don't Startle the Deer**
- Deer in forest. Move cursor slowly toward it.
- Move too fast = it flees. 
- Reach it = it turns. It's not a deer.
- *Slow precision movement.*

**21. Release the Hounds (Reverse)**
- Hounds chasing something. Click to call them back.
- They don't want to come back.
- Eventually they return. With something in their mouths.
- *Clicking to resist momentum.*

**22. The Trophy Room**
- Mounted heads on wall. One blinks.
- Click the one that moved.
- Gets harder. More heads. More movement.
- *Spot the anomaly.*

**23. Birdsong Memory**
- Birds in a tree. Each makes a sound.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking birds.
- Final sequence = distress call. They all fly away. Silence.
- *Audio memory.*

### Interior / Domestic Paintings

**24. Set the Table**
- Place utensils correctly (Victorian etiquette).
- Wrong placement = disapproving silence.
- Perfect placement = extra chair appears. For whom?
- *Drag-drop with rules.*

**25. Wind All the Clocks**
- Room full of clocks. Wind each before they stop.
- They desync. Chaos builds.
- All stopped = frozen in time. Including you?
- *Multitasking / prioritization.*

**26. Light Sequence**
- Lamps in a hallway. Light them left to right.
- As you light the next, the previous dims.
- Reach the end = look back. Someone at the start.
- *Sequential action.*

**27. Mirror Alignment**
- Two mirrors facing each other. Adjust angles.
- Create infinite reflection. In one reflection — movement.
- *Angle adjustment puzzle.*

**28. Drawer Search**
- Desk with drawers. Open to find a key.
- Some drawers stick. Some are locked. Some have... things.
- *Point-and-click search.*

### Abstract / Surreal Paintings

**29. Color Matching**
- Abstract canvas. Parts pulse with color.
- Click colors in order of brightness (dark to light or reverse).
- Wrong order = colors bleed. Painting "dies."
- *Color perception.*

**30. Shape Assembly**
- Floating geometric shapes. Combine to form a figure.
- The figure is human. Barely.
- *Drag-combine.*

**31. Follow the Line**
- Single line weaving through canvas.
- Trace it with cursor without leaving the line.
- At the end — it's a signature. Your name? How?
- *Tracing precision.*

**32. The Spiral**
- Spiral pulling inward. Click to resist.
- Can't resist forever. Eventually you go in.
- *Futile resistance / clicking.*

## Interaction Variations

### Sound-Only Mini-Games (Black Screen)

**33. Find the Heartbeat**
- Black screen. Multiple heartbeats overlapping.
- Click when you hear THE heartbeat (the slowest one).
- It's yours. It's stopping.

**34. Name the Sound**
- Sounds play: footstep, door, breathing.
- Click in direction they came from.
- Last sound: your name whispered. From where?

**35. Silence Game**
- Make no sound. Don't click. Don't move mouse (tracked).
- Timer counts down. Any input = fail.
- What are you hiding from?

### Meta / 4th Wall

**36. Painting Loads**
- Progress bar: "Entering painting..."
- It stalls. Resets. Progress lost.
- Eventually: "The painting refuses." You're kicked out.

**37. Wrong Painting**
- Enter a painting. It's a previous one.
- Same puzzle but... wrong. Details changed.
- Did you dream the first time?

**38. Painting Watches**
- No puzzle. Just a landscape.
- Wait. Look. Nothing happens.
- Quit to hub. Painting has changed. You're in it now.

---

## Ultra-Simple (Game Jam Friendly)

**39. Hold Your Breath**
- Single prompt: "Hold SPACE"
- Screen darkens slowly. Sound fades.
- How long can you hold? Release = return to hub.
- The child can't hold long.

**40. Close Your Eyes**
- Prompt: "Press E to close eyes"
- Black screen. Sounds play. Something approaches.
- Press E again to open. Is it gone?
- *Two-state tension.*

**41. Wait for Morning**
- Just wait. A clock shows 3:00 AM.
- Real-time seconds = game minutes.
- Things happen in the room. Don't react.
- Morning comes. Eventually.

**42. One Button**
- Red button. "Don't press."
- Nothing happens if you don't.
- If you do — the painting is ruined. No fragment. Your fault.

## Design Notes

- Every mini-game should end with the **cutting ritual** — unify the loop
- "Victory" is never clean — always a cost, always something wrong
- Sound design carries 70% of the horror
- Visuals can be minimal if audio is strong
- Let the player's imagination do the work
